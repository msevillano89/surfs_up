# Surfs Up Analysis
### Overview of the analysis
We are looking to open a Surf n' Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists in Oahu. Our potential investor W. Avy initially required weather analysis, specifically precipitation trends throughout the year on the island. Now he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. W. Avy wants temperature data for June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Results
- **June temperature analysis result**

- **December temperature analysisult**

- There are minimal differences between average temperatures between June and December. The average temperature in June is 75 F, while the average temperature in December is 71 F, roughly a 5-degree difference.
- However, the spread of temperatures -the difference between max and min temperature- is much more prominent in December than in June. The business might be more susceptible to a wider variety of temperature ranges. 
- Lastly, there are more temperature recordings in June than in December. Nonetheless, this should not have a significant impact on the final analysis. Overall the temperature ranges for both months prove to be favorable for the business venture. 

### Summary
The tables above provide a quick understanding of the weather in the area. Still, additional context is needed to fully understand the potential impact the weather on the island has on our business venture:

#### Precipitation analysis
Although our previous analysis provided a full-year outlook on precipitation trends, I conducted an additional study to understand the average precipitation for June and December.

We expect higher inches of rain in December compared to June from the results. The more significant concern would be the likelihood of reaching max precipitation, 4 inches, and 6 inches in June and December, respectively, as it would have a detrimental impact on our business. 

### Full-Year Outlook
The initial analysis was limited to two months, June (Summer) and December (Winter). To better understand if the venture would be profitable all year round, I conducted the same analysis for March (Spring) and September(Fall). As shown in the study below, we can confirm that the average temperature throughout the year is about 70 F, good weather for our business venture.
